# Git-Workflow-Basics

Names : Caleb, Matt, Chase, Agustin

We faced a couple of challenges while trying to do this project.
The first challenge was figuring out how to use different git commands.
We had to do some research and experimentation for this.
The second challenge was figuring out what order to do steps in.
This challenge was also resolved by doing a bit more research.
