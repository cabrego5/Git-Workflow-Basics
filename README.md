# Git-Workflow-Basics

Names : Caleb, Matt, Chase, Agustin

We faced a few of challenges while trying to do this project.
One challenge was figuring out how to use different git commands.
Another challenge was figuring out what order to do steps in. The last
challenge was learning how to use branches and learning how to set an
upstream for branches. All of our challenges were resolved by 
experimentation and researching how git commands are used. We also faced challenges
with the vs code system and making sure everyone was on the correct branch then making 
their own branch before committing it back to the repository.
