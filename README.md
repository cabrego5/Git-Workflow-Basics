# Git-Workflow-Basics

Names : Caleb, Matt, Chase, Agustin

We faced a few of challenges while trying to do this project.
One challenge was figuring out how to use different git commands.
Another challenge was figuring out what order to do steps in. 
We faced some difficulty in learning how to use branches and set an
upstream for branches. These challenges were resolved by experimentation
and researching how git commands are used. Additionally, we had some 
trouble with the vs code system and making sure everyone was on the correct branch
before committing it back to the repository.
